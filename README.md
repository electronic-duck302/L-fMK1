# miniCORE
A small coreXY 3d printer

This is a work in progress, and is currently still in the design phase.

miniCORE is a small corexy printer based around the prusa mini bed size, and is designed to be as compact as I can make it. Any suggestions for improvements are very welcome, however may take a while to implement. 

##Preliminary specs:

*180x180x180 build volume
*CoreXY Motion system running on MGN12 linear rails
*Belted Z axis (eliminates Z Wobble, and with 0.9 degree steppers, and 16t GT2 pulleys can produce normal layer heights just fine)
*SKR V1.4 W/ Raspberry pi 4 Running Klipper
*E3D Hemera Extruder
*E3D 0.9 degree stepper motors for A,B,Z axes
*Solid V-slot extrusion Frame(Should also work with T slot, but V slot is cheaper here)
*Enclosable (This may become easier, I'll see how it goes fitting the XY steppers inside the frame, but atm they're sort of hanging out the back)

Any suggestions ar very welcome, I'm going to upload the cad for most of the frame and the Z axis soon

* Bullet list
